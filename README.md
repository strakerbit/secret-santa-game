# Secret Santa

This project is a simple implementation of a "Secret Santa" game, where users can add names to a list, randomly draw a friend from the list, and remove that friend once they have been drawn. It is developed in JavaScript and HTML and can be run directly in a browser.

- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Web styling
- **JavaScript**: Logic of the application (managing the friend list, drawing friends, etc.).

## Common Issues

- **The list is empty**: If you try to draw a friend when there are no names in the list, an alert will show indicating the list is empty.
  
- **There is only one friend in the list**: If you try to draw a friend when there is only one, an alert will show that at least two friends are required to draw.
